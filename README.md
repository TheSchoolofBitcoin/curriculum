```
Fork this repository to create a conceptual design for your financial literacy DAO.
```

The School of Bitcoin is creating a DAO focused on creating a Decentralized Autonomous Education System (DAES) centered around financial literacy. The path to creating TSOBTC's DAO will be marked by the curriculum DAOs we create. Each curriculum is designed as a DAO because their underlying cryptoeconomic protocols will help reinforce the financial principles being learned.

TSOBTC's first curriculum DAO, The Bit Entry Program, is focused on creating a base curriculum for Bitcoin and the new wave of crypto that is emerging. The Bit Entry program is a program from TSOBTC's Stacks Australia chapter.  

### Challenge
According to new research by Finder, "A nationally representative survey of 1,013 respondents revealed almost half of Australians (46%) wished they'd learnt how to invest during their time at school, while 44% wish they'd learnt how to manage their money." Thiand will serve as an example for how people can create financial literacy DAOs catered to their own community.

### Proposed Solution
Develop the Stacks Australia/NZ DAO as an acceible bridge between the existing education system to web3 with an introduction to financial literacy. The values in the API below represents the metadata/proof-of-work for The Bit Entry Program's DAO Conceptual Design. To create a conceptual design for your own financial literacy course or program, please fork this repository and your own values. We are currently working on clear documentation that will help you with every step in creating your DAO.
